snscrape-jsonl-urls-extractor
=============================
extracts urls from jsonl produced by snscrape

Just run `cargo r` for usage! Rust is required.

Python version

There's a python version in the OLD_SLOW_whatever folder, but it's slow, unsupported, and produces duplicated URLs. Use the Rust version instead!
